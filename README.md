# Abstract

Marine mixotrophs, organisms that combine heterotrophic and autotrophic nutrition, are particularly well-adapted to survive in oligotrophic environments. Some of them, like corals, opt for flexibility in their photosynthetic partners to adapt to environmental changes. The question of whether the adaptive strategies of marine mixotrophs in response to global change are rooted in their symbiotic relationships remains debated, especially for calcifying larger benthic foraminifera (forams). Using single-cell metabarcoding on 243 diatom-bearing forams sampled across a gradient of turbidity, we studied its endobiome (microbiome living within the organism) to resolve the controversy regarding the flexible nature of the algal endosymbionts. Our results suggest that the flexible and adaptive nature of the foram holobiont does not lie in its algal endobiome, but within its dynamic bacterial endobiome. Diatom-bearing forams have a host-specific mutualistic symbiosis with their primary algal endosymbiont. Conversely, they harbour a surprisingly versatile, yet uniform assemblage of bacteria among host species, that likely sustains constant metabolic functions despite the variation in assemblages across the turbidity gradient. How exactly the activities of the bacterial endobiome benefit (or hinder) the adaptation of the host to environmental stress remains largely unanswered.
